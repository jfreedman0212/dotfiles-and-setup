# My Personal Dotfiles and Setup

This repository contains all the dotfiles with my preferences and a script to run if I need to quickly spin up a new machine. This is specifically for my development setup. I don't do a ton of serious development outside of work, so this config is on the lighter side.

I try to keep this up to date as I download things.
